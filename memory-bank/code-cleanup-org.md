# Code Organization and Cleanup Practices

## Overview

This document defines the standard practices for code organization and cleanup in the saga-soa project, particularly when refactoring, splitting functionality, or implementing new features.

## Core Principles

1. **Planning First**
   - Always plan changes before implementation
   - Document dependencies and impacts
   - Consider test coverage implications

2. **Clean Implementation**
   - Make changes systematically
   - Keep changes atomic and focused
   - Maintain test coverage throughout

3. **Thorough Cleanup**
   - Remove obsolete code
   - Update all affected files
   - Ensure no orphaned files remain

## Process Steps

### 1. Planning Phase
- Identify all files to be created/modified
- Map out dependencies between files
- Plan new file structure
- Document expected test coverage
- Create a checklist of changes

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Create new files first
- Update imports in affected files
- Ensure complete functionality migration
- Write/update tests as needed
- Document any deviations from plan

### 3. Cleanup Phase
- Remove original files after successful migration
- Verify no functionality was lost
- Run all tests to ensure everything works
- Update documentation if needed
- Remove any temporary files/code

### 4. Verification Checklist
- [ ] All new files are created and properly named
- [ ] All imports are updated to use new file locations
- [ ] Original file(s) are deleted
- [ ] Tests pass after the split
- [ ] No functionality was lost
- [ ] File structure follows project conventions
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] No orphaned files or dead code remains

## Common Scenarios

### Splitting Files
When splitting a file into multiple files:
1. Create all new files first
2. Move code systematically
3. Update all imports
4. Verify functionality
5. Delete original file

### Moving Functionality
When moving functionality between modules:
1. Ensure target module can accept the functionality
2. Copy functionality to new location
3. Update all references
4. Verify nothing breaks
5. Remove old code

### Interface Separation
When separating interfaces from implementations:
1. Create interface file
2. Move interface definition
3. Update implementation imports
4. Verify type checking passes
5. Clean up original file

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Make atomic commits
   - Use clear commit messages
   - Keep related changes together

2. **Testing**
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Update tests with code changes
   - Add new tests for new files

3. **Documentation**
   - Update docs with changes
   - Document breaking changes
   - Keep README files current

4. **Code Quality**
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Maintain consistent style
   - Use proper error handling
